TBD

Plan:
+ Integrate minimal model into the minimal template
+ Fix the code train data generation
+ Add running code on the validation and test sets
- Test that data preparatino works all as expected
+ Baseline with no training (cosine similarity)
- Viewer for ranking results
+ RNN architectures
- Cross encoder
- Add data to vector database
- TD-IDF baseline
- Important fix: introduce sampling of negatives instead of sampling queries for validation

Questions:
- How do you define the batch size?
