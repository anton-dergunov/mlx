TBD

Plan:
+ Integrate minimal model into the minimal template
+ Fix the code train data generation
- Add running code on the validation and test sets
+ Baseline with no training (cosine similarity)
- Viewer for ranking results
- RNN architectures
- Cross encoder
- Add data to vector database

Questions:
- How do you define the batch size?
